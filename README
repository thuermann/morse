A simple command-line encoder/decoder for the Morse code.

This code is also a nice compiler test since it uses the C preprocessor
to generate quite large and deeply nested constant expressions using
stringification, concatenation, and bit operations which the compiler
computes to an integer constant which is then used as an index in
an array initialization.
